It is the only international airport in the state of Rajasthan and thus experiences high passenger traffic. There are two terminals at <a href="https://www.cleartrip.com/tourism/airports/jaipur-airport.html" target="_blank">Jaipur International Airport</a>. The state-of-art Terminal 1 was recently built and handles both domestic and international arrivals and departures. The Terminal 2 is used exclusively for domestic carriers.</p><p>It is fairly simple to travel to and from the airport as it is well-connected by public transport. Private cabs and auto-rickshaws are available right outside the airport to get you to any part of the city. The railway and bus stations are at a distance of 13 and 11 km respectively from the airport.</p><p>A word of caution, Jaipur is characterized by dense fog in the winter season thus visibility is affected. To reach the airport, it is best to leave well in time. Also, a large number of flights are likely to be delayed or canceled or diverted.</p><p>As a major tourist destination Jaipur is unfortunately besieged by touts and hawkers, so be wary when exploring the city.</p>
