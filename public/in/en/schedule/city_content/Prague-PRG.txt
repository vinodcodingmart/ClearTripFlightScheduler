<p>Prague is the capital city of the Czech Republic. It is one of the oldest cities in Europe and is one of cultural centers of the continent with its abundance of ancient and ornate monuments, lush gardens, glitzy operas, and street performers, who break the monotonous humdrum of busy avenues with their soulful music. Prague has much to offer to travelers from the historical background of the Old Town to the buzzing and active lifestyle in the New Town; from architectural marvels to the calm waters; from ancient monumental structures to street performers.</p><p>Prague is in many ways a celebration of music, culture and history, a combination that makes for a delightfully charming lifestyle.
