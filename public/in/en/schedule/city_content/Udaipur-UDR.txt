Initially a military airport, used for the transportation of ammunition, it is now a fully-functional domestic airport. The domestic terminal at the <a href="https://www.cleartrip.com/tourism/airports/udaipur-airport.html" target="_blank">Maharana Pratap Airport</a> has a single boarding gate on the ground level and there are two aerobridges on the first level. There is a special terminal for chartered airlines that provides services for the Border Security Forces and Indian Air Force. This terminal can only be accessed by defense and authorized personnel for security reasons.</p><p>Traveling to and from the airport is not difficult as the city bus service is available just outside the airport.
