Singapore Airline’s First Class is one of the premium carriers when it comes to air luxury experiences one can have. I was traveling from Sydney to Singapore and was the only one in the first class cabin. The flight attendants were very attentive and just a pleasure. I am not the biggest fan of Asian cuisine and so I had preordered a continental meal that was very good.

Singapore airlines are very good in terms of service, comfort, and even food in most people’s opinion. I would, however, appreciate it if we could have more options to choose from in terms of food and beverage. The crew and staff are generally very helpful and polite.

The flight was around 15 minutes late due to weather conditions and there was also some delay in take off due to the same. The crew and pilots were quite professional and kept us updated on everything. The food was served on time and beverages were being offered throughout the flight as well.

I have always had a pleasant experience with this carrier. My flight was from Hong Kong to Singapore and I was in Economy. Unfortunately my entertainment system wasn’t working. Even after attempts to reset it from the crew it didn’t work. The food made up for the faulty in flight entertainment equipment. Though I still wish I’d carried a book in my hand bag. Apart from that It was a relaxed experience.
