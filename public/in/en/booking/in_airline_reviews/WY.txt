It was a really good flight. The only problem I faced was that there was a problem with the in-flight entertainment system. However, the cabin crew, who were very helpful, quickly sorted that out for me. The food was satisfying and decent. I'm 6'3 and the legroom was really good for economy class.

The crew at the check-in counter are not very welcoming. The staff aboard were no better. While flying, you are only offered a meal and nothing else after it. The plane is clean and comfortable and the selection of in-flight entertainment is good. Oman Air should concentrate on training its staff well.

My husband and I are really disappointed by Oman Air. We were supposed to take the flight from Chittagong to London (with a stop at Muscat). Our flight was scheduled to leave Chittagong at 9:30 pm. However, even after all the passengers got in, it didn’t budge and no announcement was given for the delay.

I used to like the Oman Air flights. However, this time it was different. This time when we boarded, we sat waiting for almost an hour. The air conditioning wasn’t on and there was no one to tell what was going on. Due to the extreme heat many kids even started crying.
