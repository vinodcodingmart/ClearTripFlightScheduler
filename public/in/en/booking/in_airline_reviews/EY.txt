I had read so many negative reviews prior to my trip which made me nervous about flying with Etihad. However, I was pleasantly surprised and I can honestly say that the service and attitude of the flight attendants were all excellent. I enjoyed the food. The seat was relatively comfortable and the in-flight entertainment was decent.

I took the new Dreamliner flight from the Etihad fleet. While the in-flight entertainment as well as the other services were good, I felt that the seats could have been a little more padded. Also, the in-flight service and staff werenâ€™t as up to the mark as compared to the other Etihad flights.

We had a really good trip from Auckland to Paris (with a stop in Abu Dhabi). We decided to choose Etihad because they have a good reputation and also had a special fare going at that time. We were served a very good dinner with cutlery, and, post that, there was popcorn, muffins and drinks offered too! A real treat!

I found nothing spectacular with my journey by Etihad. The food and drinks were just like you would get on other airlines. The seats were comfy though; no complains there. I did find the baggage drop and check-in particularly nice as it was very quick and convenient. The staff seemed a little indifferent though; quite mechanical. They got the job done though.
