Air Peace airlines is my preferred airlines to fly to Abuja and Accra from Lagos where I stay. Obviously there is scope for improvement when it comes to services, meals and comfort. Safe journey is what they bank on and take required measures.  My flight was late by 45minutes but I reached safely. Their crew is very helpful.

To be very frank, I did not expect top-notch services from this low budget airline. When I browsed Air Peace airlines booking page, I faced no issue going ahead with the bookings, thanks to their FAQ on reservations for booking information. I wanted to change my flight timing and faced no issues at all! Though it is not the best, but you can definitely consider flying with them.

I was looking for flights from Abuja to Lagos and found many Air Peace cheap flights. A friend of mine had suggested this airline and so I took his advice and booked tickets, I remember I was a bit sceptical as it was my first time on this budget airline. After travelling with them I can say that I made the right choice. Air Peace flight booking system online is also very efficient. Plus, the aircraft was neat and the crew was both polite and professional. I would definitely fly with Air Peace again!

Air Peace is Good, I would say above average. They serve quality food on flight, have comfortable seats, and also have well-maintained aircrafts. Air Peace flight search is easy and online booking via travel sites or airline website is also cool. Nevertheless, they must pay attention to cabin crew behavior as I did not find them friendly towards passengers.
