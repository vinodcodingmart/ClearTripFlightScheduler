I travelled from New Delhi to Kolkata by Air India Express Indian airlines last week, and it was a nice experience overall. Spacious legroom, complimentary snacks and professional on-board staff are few aspects that impressed me. However, they need to concentrate on their ground service because they do not have sufficient staff at New Delhi terminal.

My New Delhi to Indore flight was very swift and definitely on time. I had to attend a meeting and could not afford flight delay and the airline did not disappoint me. While doing Air India Express Flights online booking I was surprised with the cash back that I received. I am happy that I chose to travel with them.

While travelling by air, baggage allowance is one my concerns. I am happy to state that on Air India Express Airlines, the baggage permissible limit was 32 Kgs and since I travel with a lot of luggage, I prefer them over any other airlines. More reasons why I prefer this airline is that they have spacious flights, on-board meals are nice and crew is friendly. I strongly recommend Air India Express to every traveler.

Air India Express flights are usually on time and match my business schedule well. So while travelling from Delhi to Chandigarh, I opt for an early morning flight. Besides, Air India Express Cheap flights serve tasty snacks.
