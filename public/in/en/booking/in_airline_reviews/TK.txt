My first flight with Turkish Airlines was a while ago. I choose this airline often because they offer very good value for the money. My last flight was 11 hours long. You get great food and drinks and an excellent choice of entertainment. Although I feel that the toilets could have been cleaner.

I enjoyed the complementary Wi-Fi on my last flight with Turkish Airlines. I also really liked the Turkish delight they were giving at the beginning of the fight because it is a traditional Turkish dessert that introduces the passengers into the Turkish culture. The food and seats were nice too.

My experience with TA was great. They had good service, good food, good seating and a good crew. The aircraft was new and it was maintained very well. TA gives excellent value for money. One tip to travel with TA is that you should always plan your journey and book ahead.

I have flown with Turkish airlines quite a few times and each time it has been mostly great service for both international and domestic flights. I also think that the food on Turkish airlines is great and they refill your drink for you whenever you ask them. I would highly recommend this airline.
