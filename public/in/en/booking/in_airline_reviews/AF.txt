The airplane was one of the older models, which was disappointing. I am not satisfied with the entertainment - old and small screen with a very limited selection of films and TV shows. The food was fine although the quantity could be better. The plane was on time. Overall, a decent experience.

We took a flight from Prague to Paris on business class with Air France. I was disappointed because even in business class the airline gives the same seats as in economy, but the middle seat is blocked out. The flight attendants very attentive and friendly from start to finish.

Overall it was an ok flight. The boarding process was smooth and quick. The gate agents were polite and efficient. It was a short haul flight and therefore there was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were a little uncomfortable. The flight attendants were also nice. Wouldn’t recommend for long haul flights.

The crew was very polite and helpful. The seats and interior, however, were old. The in-flight entertainment screen was quite small and did not work the best. I would say that the food is average. I believe that Air France can do better in this area. Otherwise, the service was nice and efficient.
