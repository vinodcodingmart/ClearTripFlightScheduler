Professional crew of Air Asia Airlines do make a huge difference. Although the flight was delayed, the staff was prompt in informing. I am still ok with travelling with them as at least they were available and responded quickly to my queries. I do not like circumference talking, and they were to the point in whatever I asked. This helped in planning further as well.

I had to travel from Bangalore to Kochi, and I am happy to choose Air Asia. Clean flight is something I have always appreciated. Even food quality is worth mentioning. Air Asia Airlines Booking wasn't cumbersome. The ground staff seems to be very helpful and although I wasn't travelling with a child, but could see that the staff was helpful to those travelling with kids.  This was indeed a great sight to look at!

Air Asia Flight ticket price is lower than what you can think. I travelled from Amritsar to Bali with a layover at Kuala Lumpur and my experience was okay. Not excellent but not bad too.  I have used many budget airlines so comparatively Air Asia is a little better in terms of on-board snacks and food quality. The service is good.

I needed a flight to Singapore and when I carried Airasia flight search on Cleartrip, I could see all the flights on this route displayed on my screen.  Although the travel experience was good but with little more leg room I would have enjoyed more since I am tall. Flight was on time and crew was smiling and friendly. I donâ€™t like stern faces. Recommended airlines. Value for Money!

The main thing why I choose to travel with this airline is huge savings through exciting Air Asia Flight Offer. I have travelled to both international as well as domestic destinations and found that International flights are more comfortable. They have better food options. The only thing that irritated me was that washrooms could be cleaner.
