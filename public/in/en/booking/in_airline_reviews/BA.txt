I chose to travel with BA after a long time and was pleasantly surprised at the professional service of the staff and crew members this time around. The seat was fine as well, quite comfortable for me as I got the aisle seat. The unwelcome change was the fact that they now charged for food. But I guess that is to be expected with budget cuts.

I often travel with British Airways because they have really good connectivity to most destinations around Europe. I love that their flights are usually on schedule and that their staff is very professional. The in flight entertainment is great, with a variety of options to choose from. I’d say that they could improve their menu, seeing as they now make you pay for meals.

I was quite disappointed with my journey with British Airways this time. They ran out of food of my choice, and I was stuck eating a vegan meal because that is all that was left and I was too hungry to sit out the whole journey without a rumbling stomach. To pay for any services like Wi-Fi, they only accept cards and not cash. My card didn’t work with them for some reason, so I couldn’t even access the Wi-Fi. However, it’s worth mentioning that the crew was very professional through all this.

A friend and I traveled with British Airways for our trip to Nice. She was in Business class and I was in Economy but it was like we were on different flights. While Business class passengers were given a meal and beverages, we had to pay for it. The crew was also more attentive to them and not us. I had to wait for a long time to get the bottle of water I requested. The difference in our tickets was highlighted quite obviously.
