I didn’t like my experience with Emirates. I was going for a holiday to Tokyo. The lady at the check-in counter was very rude and kept asking me the same questions over and over again. While the in-flight experience was good, that encounter at the airport actually spoilt my mood. The flight was late landing too, which added fuel to the fire.

This was my seventh flight with Emirates. As usual, they didn’t disappoint. The seat on this airline’s aircrafts are very comfortable have plenty of legroom. There was also a wide selection in terms of food and movies. No matter how long the flight, the in-flight entertainment system will always keep you busy. If I had to nitpick, I’d say the flight has a delayed departure; however they made up for lost time and we arrived in time.

Many airlines should take note of how Emirates treats its customers. They take good care of all their passengers, even the ones in the economy class. The food is decent as compared to the ones available on other flights and I can say the same thing about the seats as well.

For me and my family, Emirates is one of the best airlines you can travel on. The staff is extremely friendly and always greets you with a smile. The seats are extremely comfortable and the food is decent. The in-flight entertainment system caters to adults as well as children. However, Emirates could work on their punctuality a little.
