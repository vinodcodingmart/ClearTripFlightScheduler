On all the flights Iâ€™ve been on Srilankan Airlines, they always seem to be full, so they must be doing something right. The In flight entertainment in the older aircrafts is generally not as good as on the newer planes. Catering is average in the economy class. The crew is professional and polite.

This was our first experience of Sri Lankan. The flight was full and left Heathrow after a delay of 15 minutes. Food was a bit of a hit and miss. The on board team was polite and attentive. Entertainment is spoiled by lengthy advertisements that precede the actual films. Otherwise, it was quite comfortable.

We flew from Paris to Colombo with Srilankan airline and it was amazing! Even in comparison with other airlines with whom we had flown on our trips. The flight attendants were so lovely and the service was full of little extras that really made the difference. The food was also great, which makes a long trip much more bearable.

This was my first experience with Srilankan airlines and it was great. I was disappointed as my seat wasn't near my family. However, the amazing crew managed to give me a seat that was close to my mother. I particularly enjoyed the safety video in the flight. The crew was very helpful. The in flight entertainment, food, and overall everything was much better than my expectations.
