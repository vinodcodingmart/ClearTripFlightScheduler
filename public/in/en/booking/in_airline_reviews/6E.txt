I travelled by the Bengaluru to Mumbai flight yesterday. While the seats were comfortable, there wasnâ€™t enough legroom, especially for someone of my height and size. I did find out from other passengers that seats with more legroom cost a little more. Will probably consider that option the next time I go IndiGo.

I have travelled across different routes by IndiGo airlines. While there is a difference in staff behavior across routes, the airline is more consistent on other grounds. I found the seats in all the flights comfortable. The food (provided you checked for the meal option) was also good across all flights.

I always prefer to fly by IndiGo. It is cheap, offers good service, and is always on time. The IndiGo staff are also extremely polite and helpful and ensures that you are comfortable on your journey. The airline even offers good food. Would always recommend people to fly by IndiGo.

This is my third time flying by IndiGo. I caught the Delhi to Mumbai flight.Pros: Comfortable seats, polite staff, always on time, cheap flight tickets.Cons: An ok in-flight entertainment system. For food you have to pay extra. No extra legroom, which can be quite bothersome if you are tall.
