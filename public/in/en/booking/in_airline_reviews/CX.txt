The first thing that came to my notice when I entered the aircraft was that it was really clean. I had a hard time fitting my luggage in the luggage compartment because it was almost full. The flight attendant really helped and rearranged the whole row to make room for my luggage. The service was great and the food was good too.

We were traveling with Cathay Pacific from London to Hong Kong in Business class. Thus, we had access to the lounge, which was unfortunately closed. So we were accommodated in another lounge that wasn’t nearly as nice as the Cathay Pacific one. The flight was better than the lounge. Clean aircraft, good food and great service.

For me, traveling with Cathay has been a good experience. First, you are addressed by name, offered beverages and so on. Out bound meals were superb and there were many courses as well. Seats were comfortable and they had a good selection of movies. All food was very high standard and service was personal and friendly.

 Overall my flight was pleasant. We went through quite a bit of turbulence but, obviously, that wasn’t the fault of the airline. In fact the pilot reassured us over the PA system that it was just due to weather conditions. I couldn’t really sleep so ended up watching a movie. Food was just okay.
