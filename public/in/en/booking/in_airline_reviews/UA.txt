This was my first time flying United and the experience was unpleasant. The flight was a five hour flight. I found that the airline was stingy when it came to serving refreshments. We were offered one snack and small drinks twice in the whole flight. There were limited amenities as there was no TV or radio on board.

My flight with UA was fine. We had a quick check in, and everything was on time. The attendants and desk staff were all very nice. There was no difficulty with seating even though I was in economy class, especially since the seat beside me was empty. The food could definitely be better.

My flight with United Airlines was quite unpleasant because I got food poisoning flying from San Francisco to Sydney. I donâ€™t know if it was United's food or something I ate at the airport. But I started throwing up half an hour into the flight. I had horrible spasms in my stomach. The crew helped me out.

My flight with UA was a connection flight after my long-haul flight from Doha to Miami. I had to pay extra for baggage for this flight, which was disappointing. The check in process was lengthy as well. The flight departed on time. It was comfortable. Crew response was average. Nothing really stood out here.
