I had a good experience with JetLite. The flight had a really nice cabin crew. The only thing I didnâ€™t like as much was their slightly confusing check-in procedure.  Otherwise, the flight was quite pleasant.

The aircraft was fresh and clean. I found the seats to be very cozy and they even had good legroom. The flight attendants did their job, but a little too mechanically. The sad part being that the flight had no entertainment options, except for some outdated magazines.

I was traveling with my little one and the seating with a little bit of legroom meant we were both cramped. However, the food was tasty and the cabin crew was quick to respond to requests.
