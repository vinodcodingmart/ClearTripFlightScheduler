We took the Dubai to London flight. The flight was really comfortable. For a low budget airline, it had a lot of leg room and slightly wider seats. The one thing we found amusing was the way the security features of the plane were explained. Instead of introducing them in the standard way they used a film in which kids explained it.

I had a horrible experience this time. I used to like this airline before but my last two experiences were really bad. I was travelling with my family to Tbilisi and back. The counter staff allocated us seats in different locations. This happened both times. When approached, the staff was very rude and not ready to help.

Air Arabia works as a typical low cost airline. The cabin crew go through the motions with absolutely no enthusiasm. Everything else in the flight such as food and drinks has to be paid for, but as this is a budget airline, it’s to be expected. It’s difficult to get help with information such as from which baggage carousel is your luggage to be collected.

I usually keep travelling between Casablanca and Venice. Usually the flights are delayed. However, most passengers like me tend to overlook it. However, this time, I found the ground staff at the airport in Casablanca were very rude. Since there wasn’t enough place to take the hand luggage aboard, they ended up putting it with the normal luggage.
