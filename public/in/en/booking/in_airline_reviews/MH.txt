The stewardess on the plane was really accommodating. The food was fine but I wasn’t full so I asked for another helping and the stewardess gave it to me for free! The plane was clean but it was quite old and so some in flight equipment wasn’t working very well. Overall, the experience was good but I hope they can maintain their aircrafts better.

I flew with Malaysia airlines from Kuala Lumpur to London in business class. The seat is very big and comfortable. I had preordered my food and it was served to me on time with a variety of drinks to choose from. The food was very good, like a five star restaurant. The cabin crew was very attentive and helpful.

We flew with Malaysia Airlines because their tickets were very affordable. Overall our experience was pretty good. There was some issue with our baggage as we had to run out and get a fragile sticker for one bag and we ended up rushing to catch our flight. The staff in the flight was very helpful and friendly.

Flew with MA from Delhi to Singapore in Economy. I was traveling with my husband and infant daughter and the air hostess was very helpful and accommodating. She helped us move to the back of the plane where there was more space and we could sit comfortably. That was very proactive on her part and much appreciated.
