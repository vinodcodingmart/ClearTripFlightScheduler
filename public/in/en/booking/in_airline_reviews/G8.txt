My experience with GoAir was good. We boarded and landed just on time. The staff was co-operative. The food, though not bad, was of acceptable quality. The seats were slightly uncomfortable but passable. I lost my small bag once but the staff made sure I got it back on time. All in all, it was a nice flight.

Overall great experience. The boarding and take off were on time, and we reached Delhi as per the estimated schedule. The food was hygienic though not to my taste. The flight crew was kind and courteous. Our luggage was handled well. Bathrooms were clean and the crew was dedicated to keeping it so.

I was traveling alone with my 15 months old infant to Bengaluru so ease of check in baggage and boarding procedure was very important to me. The process was fine but it took too long because only one check-in counter was open. The flight was decent. The staff was very helpful.

GoAir is one of the smaller Indian airlines but it operates very effectively. I have traveled with them a few times and apart from some delays I have no complaints. GoAir is a budget airline and I usually travel for short flights and I am okay with their no frills policy. The staff is always helpful.
