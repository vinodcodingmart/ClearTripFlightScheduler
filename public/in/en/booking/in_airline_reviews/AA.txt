The trip was uneventful. The passengers took a lot of time to get on the plane as well as to deplane. However, I cannot blame the airline for this. Moreover, there were no snacks or coffee served. (I am assuming that this is because the flight's duration was short).

One of the flight attendants in the first class was excellent. She was professional, courteous, and friendly. She attended to all of our needs and offered snacks and drinks as soon as we were out of them. She also ensured that we knew all the safety procedures in case of an emergency.

This was our first trip to America via American Airlines. The in-flight entertainment system was a letdown. There was only one large TV unit in the center of the aisle showing movies. The staff was friendly and the food was good. The best part was that we got to disembark and clear through customs quickly.

American Airlinesâ€™ first class seating is no better than some of those in premium economy of other airlines. The service is lacking and the staff does not seem so focused on the customers. The last time I was flying with my sister, we had asked for free headphones. However, flight attendants were indifferent.
