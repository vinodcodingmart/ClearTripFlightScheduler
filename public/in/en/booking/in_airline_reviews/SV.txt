Saudi offers a pretty good service for its price. It was the cheapest airline I could find on the internet to fly from Singapore to Paris. Their staff are amazing. Always polite and ready to help out. You are also served 2 meals (though no snacks in between) during the flight.

I travelled from Jeddah to Dammam by Saudi Airlines. The flight was only 20 percent full (unexpected for a flight with cheap tickets). The flight reached Dammam airport a little before schedule. While there was only juice and a muffin served onboard instead of breakfast, I guess it should be expected for a cheap flight. Not bad.

This is an airline that takes you from point A to point B with nothing wrong but nothing special either. The check-in and boarding was efficient and orderly. I felt that the service onboard was a bit mechanical. The airplane was old and therefore the seats were not that comfortable.

I donâ€™t like the service by Saudi Airlines. However, this time I had to take it as it was the cheapest flight available at a short notice. The plane made a technical stop at Jeddah for almost 3 hours! This ended up in me missing my connecting flight from the Toronto airport.
