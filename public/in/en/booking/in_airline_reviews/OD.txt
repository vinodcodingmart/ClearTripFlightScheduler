I traveled from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar with Malindo. I was in the business class but the airport lounge at Kuala Lumpur is being renovated so I didn’t get to use it. The cabin crew was attentive and tried to ensure my comfort in any way possible. I would definitely travel on Malindo Air’s business class again.

The flight with Malindo Air was very affordable. My flight was rescheduled but I was informed by call and email. This was great as I avoided wasting time and was able to reschedule my trip accordingly. The flight was decent. The seats could have a little more legroom. I would fly with them again.

I have used Malindo Air several times by now. The flights were all good for a low-budget carrier. They provide meals without extra cost which is appreciated. The food, however, is mediocre. The in-flight crew is nice and polite. I would consider flying with Malindo as it is quite affordable.

My flight with Malindo was from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and I was disappointed because we were delayed by 10 minutes. The flight was decent. I liked the fact that they have a high baggage limit. The prices are usually reasonable and they provide you with food. Overall it is okay.
