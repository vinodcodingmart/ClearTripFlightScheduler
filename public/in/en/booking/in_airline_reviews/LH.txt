I would like to describe my flight with Lufthansa as very efficient. The flight left on time and arrived at Munich airport a little before time. The flight was clean, seats were roomy and the staff were polite. I had the same experience even on the way back home.

I love how Lufthansa is focused on making your flight enjoyable. For starters, they have an excellent staff who are always there to make sure that you are comfortable and are constantly asking if you need anything. The food on board is delicious, and you also have a free beverages option.

Overall, I had a good impression of my flight to Frankfurt. I had to pay extra for an emergency exit seat due to my height. However, it was worth it. The seat was incredibly roomy, and I could sit comfortably through the entire flight. The service was good while the food was average.
