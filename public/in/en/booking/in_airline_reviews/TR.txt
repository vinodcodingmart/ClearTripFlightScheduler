We took the Guangzhou to Tiruchirappalli flight. Our checked in baggage hadnâ€™t come with us on the same flight. We registered a complaint about the same at Tiruchirappalli. The customer service agent there was very helpful. He was constantly in contact with his colleagues in Guangzhou. We managed to get our luggage by the next flight.

The flight was comfortable, on time, friendly and efficient and the fares were very good. Have flown a couple of times with TigerAir and they have been pretty efficient in terms of timings, on board service, etc. However, it is the check-in staff that really let things down. They are unnecessarily belligerent.

TigerAir is a good budget airline. The flight seats were comfortable and the leg space was sufficient too. The flight departed on time and reached its destination on time as well. They even accept credit cards on board, which is good in case you get hungry and need to purchase some snacks. Good for a non-frill airline.

I took the Bangkok to Surabaya flight (with a 2 hour stop in Singapore) by TigerAir. The flight was on time. The leg space was a little less and the seat was not very comfortable. It was a tight squeeze. Apart from that, there was no other problem in both the flights.
