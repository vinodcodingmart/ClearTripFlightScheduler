I traveled internationally for the first time with Air India from Chennai to Abu Dhabi. The check-in took a long time as there were some uncivilized passengers in the line who created a nuisance for everyone but the crew handled them well. The food was fine and the seats really need to be upholstered as they looked old.

My experience with Air India was really average. We were delayed from Kathmandu and departed after 20 minutes. The seats were uncomfortable and the flight was just old. The food was decent but not really that great. The flight attendants were very nice and made sure we were as comfortable as possible.

The flight was average. There was nothing out of the ordinary. The flight crew was polite. The food was fine and the toilets were clean. There is a very limited choice for entertainment which is a disappointing but my flight wasn’t very long so it didn’t bother me much. Overall it was okay.

We took off on time and arrived half an hour early! The food was tasty. Toilets were clean throughout the flight. The cabin crew was very friendly and attentive. Legroom was ample but the touch screen was not working that well and needed to be upgraded. Overall, it was a decent flight.
