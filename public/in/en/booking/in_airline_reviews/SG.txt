I have flown with a number of airlines and, according to me, Spicejet is a nice choice for budget travelers. The seats are usually comfortable and the food is quite good. The crew is helpful. The only thing they need to work on is being on time. Apart from that I will recommend this to anyone for short distance budget travel.

I am very happy with my experience of spicejet. The flights took off and landed on time. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The food we had was delicious as well. The seats had ample leg room and were comfortable. It was a good experience and I’d definitely recommend traveling with spicejet.

We were travelling with children and quiet harrowed but the staff of spicejet was very helpful. The flight got delayed while landing and the luggage arrival was also late. We didn’t try any food. The seats were a bit narrow but there was ample legroom. Overall it was okay. We got what we paid for.

Spicejet really needs to upgrade its aircraft. The plane was old and not very well maintained. The reading light and ac vent above my seat were not working. There is nothing in the name of in-flight entertainment and I so wish I had carried my tablet along. The crew was helpful. The food, I felt, was overcharged, so I didn’t order anything.
