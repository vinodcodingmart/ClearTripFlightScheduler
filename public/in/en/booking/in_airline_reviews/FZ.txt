I got a good deal for Flydubai. They were giving the business seats much cheaper than the economy seats in Emirates! Overall the flight was decent. The food was ok, the seat was comfortable, and the entertainment system was great. Will surely travel by this airline if I get a deal like that again.

I took the flight from Dubai to Taif by Flydubai. It was in a new plane. The sets were really comfortable even though the leg space was a little limited. I really liked their on-board service. It was simple, efficient and comfortable. Would 100 percent recommend them to anyone choosing from low-budget airlines.

This is the first time I have travelled by Flydubai. At first, I found it really hard to believe that they offered WiFi on-board for free. Then, I was simply delighted to find out that it was extremely fast. This is the first airline that I have travelled by, which does this. And it’s low budget too!

I was supposed to catch the 5 pm Dubai to Istanbul flight by flydubai. However, once we got into the plane, it didn’t start and one hour later the pilot announced that we would have to get off since there was a problem with the plane. In the end we left two hours later than scheduled. Very annoying!
