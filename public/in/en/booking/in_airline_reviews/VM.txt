I always prefer Max Air Airlines to travel within Nigeria because they have some cheapest flights. I always book their flights from various travel portals because they have exciting offers on this airlineâ€™s tickets. Ground staff is friendly and check-in is smooth. But my last flight was delayed by 30 minutes which irritated me. However, you can definitely try them for their cheap fares and professional staff.

For travelling to and from Nigeria cities, Max Air Flights is a popular option. The cheap rates and comfortable flight is positive but late departure is something they must keep a check on. They should either inform about the delays much in advance or must fly on time. This wastage of time is not good.

Last week, I traveled from Lagos to Kano by Max Air Airline, and it was really a comfortable journey. On one side where I am happy with the comfort and the cheapest airfares, but in flight entertainment is not up to the mark. What I like is that Max Air Airlines Booking is a rather simple process. Their on-board menu is quite affordable and overall my experience was good with this airline.

I travelled with Max Air from Abuja to Sokoto and Max Air Flight Search gave me all the flight options.  The cheap flights and courteous staff makes flying with them worth it. I always look forward to, when opting for Max air flights. Recommend them for often flying!
