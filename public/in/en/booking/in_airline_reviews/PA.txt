Flying Airblue airlines has indeed been a great experience. Whether it was online booking system or web check-in or getting onboard, the staff and crew of the airlines ensured that all its passengers were well taken care of.   The cabin crew was very courteous towards my 76-year-old mother and took special care of her during the flight. I highly recommend the airline for all those looking for a smooth boarding and flight experience.

Air Blue airlines staff is indeed impressive. When I complained about one of the ground staff of the airline personally, I not only received an apology, but the airline sent me a discount offer for my next flight with the airline. I have already booked my next flight with the airline and look forward to their great services whether it is food or comfortable seats. I suggest that you should fly with AirBlue airline to judge yourself.I would personally give a thumbs up!

Airblue airlines booking system online is like a breeze. I was able to browse without any glitch and search for flight schedules and look for the flights that suited my purpose. Within no time, I was able to finish the booking. I am travelling with this airline since past couple of years. Once I had to cancel the flight for some reasons, and I was given a refund though with some delay. Seat comfort and lavatories can be better. But on the whole, I'm truly very pleased with them!

I have used Airblue several times now and largely had a pleasant experience.The Airblue airlines online booking system is a hassle free way to make a flight booking or canceling a reservation. Seats are just okay when it comes to comfort but food is quite good. The staff is polite and well-behaved. Customer care is prompt!â€¨
