I recently had an unpleasant experience flying with JetKonnect. During transit, my baggage was misplaced. The customer service personnel seemed too preoccupied to help and simply said they would call me if they located it.
user-rating: 2.0
The aircraft was clean and the seats were comfortable. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I liked the food too. Although the flight departed a bit late, it touched down right on time.

The seats weren’t spacious and the legroom was too less; this caused some discomfort. I was also disappointed with the high-priced food. The services didn’t meet my expectations and were lacking in quality.
