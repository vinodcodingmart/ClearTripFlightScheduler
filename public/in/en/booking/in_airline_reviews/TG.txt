I like traveling with Thai air for long flights because there are spacious seats with a compartment on your side, which are a good size for hand luggage and handbag storage. The convertible seat converts to a flat bed. The food is great, the blanket is premium, and the cabin staff is friendly.

We went on a trip to Asia and this was my favorite airline on this trip. The plane was clean, attractive and comfortable, and service was very friendly. Food was delicious and a variety of beverages were included, even though the flight was only a little over three hours long.

I flew with Thai to Bangkok. The economy seats were very generous plenty of leg room, there was great choice of entertainment, good service excellent food and regular drinks service. I am 6ft 3in and seats were big enough to sleep comfortably with decent recline. I would highly recommend Thai Airways.

An otherwise good flight was ruined by the passenger behind me. He propped up his legs on my seat and so my seat kept moving every time he moved. I asked him to remove his feet but he pretended to be asleep and didn’t listen. I requested for another seat but couldn’t get it because the flight was full.
