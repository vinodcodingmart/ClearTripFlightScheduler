Flying on Jet Airways was truly a pleasant experience for me. Considering that it is a budget airline, I was extremely impressed by the quality of service, flight cleanliness, timely take off and landing and the efficient management it took to handle it all. However, if I had to nitpick, I’d say the menu could do with a revamp.

I loved my experience with Jet Airways. I was travelling on the Delhi to Nagpur flight. The staff was extremely polite and friendly. The food they served was really nice too, and the seat was really comfortable. I like the service very, very much. I’ve travelled with Jet Airways a couple of times and they have been on schedule most of the time.

I had a very pleasant experience with Jet Airways. The staff here know how to help mothers with very young children. I was travelling alone with my three-month-old daughter and was, thus, a little anxious. However, the flight attendants were very nice and helpful, especially when I had to get her diaper changed.

I had booked flight tickets on Jet Airways for my grandparents as they wanted to come to visit me. They told me that the staff were very helpful. They helped with all the check-in formalities as well. They also helped them board and get off the flight. They have both told me to book their return tickets only on Jet Airways.
