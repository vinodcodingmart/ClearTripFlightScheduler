For our trip to Singapore, we decided to go all in and purchased business class tickets with Qatar. It was a good decision, I must say, and we were happy to get a bang for our buck. The service is almost as good as the service of other airline’s first class. They even provided us with really high-quality pajamas to sleep in. They could probably add a few more food choices for at least the business and first class.

Qatar used to be a good airline but recently I haven’t been as pleased with them. I found the service to be sluggish, and the food to be of worse quality than before. The staff’s attentiveness failed to impress me. They still have better seats than most but could definitely improve the other facets.

I chose Qatar for my trip to Doha from New York City. I was looking forward to a good flight having read the amazing reviews. The seat was quite uncomfortable for me. I am a fairly tall person, but I had wished there would be more leg room on this airline. Combine this with an annoying co passenger, and I had a pretty long and unpleasant flight.

Quite frankly I was disappointed with my flight with QA. We heard a lot about this airline and decided to give it a try for a long haul journey of seven hours. Well, my TV wasn’t working and nothing could be done so I had a pretty boring flight. The quantity of food was enough, but I didn’t like the taste much.
