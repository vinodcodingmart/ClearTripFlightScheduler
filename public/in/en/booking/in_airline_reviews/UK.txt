I am amazed at the service provided by Vistara. I was travelling with my infant child, and the airhostess made a bed for my baby girl to sleep in. The same airhostess was also prompt to come to my assistance when my sweetheart showed signs of discomfort. I was so happy with the food and the seats were comfortable as well. It was like a mini vacation for me. I will wholeheartedly recommend Vistara for flying in India.

I took a flight from Mumbai to Delhi in January with Vistara. The business class is very good compared to other Indian airlines. I was offered a menu with a nice variety of options to choose from. The food was also good. The crew was very courteous and helpful. There was some delay in landing due to fog and I missed an important meeting, which is unfortunate. That’s why one star is deducted.

This was my first time traveling with Vistara. I was on an A320 aircraft flying from Delhi to Mumbai. I was quite pleased with the experience. I am over 6 feet tall so seats are usually cramped for me but Vistara’s premium economy was an exception. The food was delicious unlike the swill served on most other airlines. I passed the time with a movie on the tab that was provided.

Vistara is one of the best airlines flying in the Indian space. I have traveled with them quite often. I am always pleased with the professionalism of the crew. The food is also quite good with different varieties for different flights. I was also given a tablet preloaded with some movies to will away the time. A good experience overall, I must say.
