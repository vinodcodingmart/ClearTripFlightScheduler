<h1>Tigerair Baggage Policy</h1><p>Looking at a carrier’s services before opting for a flight is very important, and knowing how much baggage allowance it provides is important too. Tigerair’s baggage policy offers passengers who only have hand luggage, the choice of saving money on their ticket by not having to pay for checked luggage. However, those who choose to check-in baggage may do so by opting for the Luggage Upsize option that entails a highly affordable fee. </p><h2>Checked luggage allowance </h2><p>As per Tigerair’s baggage allowance rules, if you wish to carry checked luggage, you will need to choose the Luggage Upsize option during booking. This will allow you to purchase 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 kgs of luggage allowance. While opting for Luggage Upsize during booking, you can buy your allowance at affordable rates. However, if you purchase it through the customer contact center, via the Manage My Booking option, during Web check-in, or at the airport, the rates will be higher. </p><p>If you choose to purchase at the airport, your options will only be restricted to 15 and 20 kgs. On exceeding this limit, you will be charged for the excess baggage. </p><h2>Cabin luggage allowance</h2><p>The hand baggage allowance for Tigerair passengers is 2 bags having a combined weight of 10 kgs. However, you must ensure that the dimensions of each piece adhere to the 54 x 38 x 23 cms limit. </p><h2>Restricted items</h2><p>The airline prohibits passengers from carrying hazardous items. However, there are certain things that the airline does not permit in both checked and cabin baggage. This includes explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizing substances, toxic/infectious substances, corrosive materials, and radioactive materials, besides other dangerous goods. Certain items may be permitted in either checked luggage or cabin luggage. Some items may be permitted in both. </p><p>Now, forget about your baggage woes and pack efficiently by referring to these details.
