<p>JetLite was a no-frills, domestic flying carrier of Jet Airways. It has been taken over by Jet Konnect since March 25, 2012. At the time, Mr. Naresh Goyal, the Founder and Chairman of Jet Airways, stated that the idea behind rebranding and merging is to offer their guests a superior, full-service, in-flight product at cheaper airfare. Konnect will also offer premium services on some routes that were primarily under the Jet Airways schedule. </p>
<p>Jet Airways Konnect provides flying services to most states in India, with a mixed fleet of ATR and Boeing aircraft. Committed to providing affordable carrier services, this airline operates on metro, tier II and III routes, under the S2 and 9W codes. </p>
<p>Konnect also offers the JetPrivilege membership for frequent flyers. All the Platinum, Gold and Silver card members may earn and redeem JP Miles on Konnect flights. </p>
<p>In Konnect flights, passengers may purchase food and beverages on board through the JetCafe service. Premi√®re guests will enjoy a full-meal service, seat pitch, and on-ground offerings such as special check-in counters and lounge access. </p>
