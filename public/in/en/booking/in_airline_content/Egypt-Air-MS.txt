<h2>On-board EGYPTAIR</h2>

<p>The aviation company was established in May 1932, under the Misr Airwork brand name. In 1935, during the Second World War, the Egyptian Government took over the airline and it was renamed as Misr Airlines. In 1946, there was again a change in the name and it was renamed as MisrAir. In 1960, MisrAir was merged with Syrian Airlines. This gave way to the formation of United Arab Airlines (UAA). In 1969, UAA became the first airline in the Middle East to fly Boeing 707s.
