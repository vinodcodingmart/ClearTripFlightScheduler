<p>Air One plans to start operations in the first half of 2015, and is promoted by Alok Sharma, who has an in-depth knowledge of the aviation industry from serving as Chief of Air Sahara. The Aviation Ministry of India has given them a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and the airline is in the process of making a choice between Airbus A320s or Boeing 737s to make up its fleet. It will be headquartered in New Delhi. </p>
<p>Air One Aviation has been running charter services for a few years, flying to domestic and international destinations with a fleet of smaller aircraft. This experience would be put to good use when starting a dual-class full service airline. The venture is backed by investors and its management consists of many executives who were formerly with Air Sahara. </p>
