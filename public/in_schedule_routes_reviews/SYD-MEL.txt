Last month, I have booked a ticket with Virgin Australia as it offers cheapest Sydney to Melbourne flights through Cleartrip. Also, I got instant cash-back points from Cleartrip. My overall experience was good but the only downside is that they do not offer any snacks or beverage complimentary.

Etihad Airways is the best airline to travel from Sydney to Melbourne. I am saying it because I often travel with this airline on this route and I always prefer Cleartrip for booking my tickets because it is fast, convenient, cost effective and easy to navigate.

Last month, I travelled with Emirates, and the Sydney to Melbourne flight was delayed by 3 hours. Also, they did not send any prior notification to me which was the most irritating part. The only good aspect was booking on Cleartrip at cool price. The flight though was good but at least they must give passengers the information about change in flight schedule.

Few days ago, I have booked Sydney to Melbourne flights through Cleartrip and it was in Sunstate Airlines. The flight was good, their baggage clearance system was very fast, and their cabin staff was well polished. Food provided on the flight was also decent, and thanks to Cleartrip for helping me find a good deal.

Hey guys, just booked a flight from Sydney to Melbourne with JetStar because I have travelled with this airline many times before and I always had a great experience. Also, it is cheap, and comfortable. Their professional staff is always ready to help. Go for it and do not forget to book your tickets through Cleartrip, because I always get added bonus points in my wallet on each booking. Best of luckâ€¦.
