Goa is one of my favorite travel destinations so I visit the city almost every year. Last week, I travelled with my family to Goa and I had booked my Bangalore to Goa flight through Cleartrip on IndiGo.  It was great, easy and convenient. The flight was on time and staff behaved well.

Recently I visited Goa and I booked Bangalore to Goa flight on Go Air. I did bookings with Cleartrip and it was really cost-effective. Service was good, seats were comfortable and it was on-time. Only baggage clearance at the Bangalore airport was frustuser-rating due to long queue. Breathed a sigh of relief when I boarded the flight as I thought we would be late

Last week, I travelled from Bangalore to Goa on an Air India flight and it was not a good experience for me. They offered only vegetarian food and they did not have any other choice for their passengers. Apart from that, there was less leg room. However booking via Cleartrip was nice and I got instant confirmation sms.

Bangalore to Goa flights are available by many airlines. After doing research, I booked my flight tickets with IndiGo as they were offering cheap air tickets.  Like most airlines, they too offer 15kgs check-in luggage but I had 22 kgs for which I had to pay more. Apart from this extra cost, everything was fine. I always prefer Cleartrip for booking my tickets. It is nice, easy to navigate and I can book my tickets through my mobile phone as well.

Last month, I travelled by IndiGo Airlines Bangalore  to Goa flight and had a nice experience. No problem with food, cabin crew behavior, baggage or cleanliness. And yes, thanks to Cleartrip for providing me such convenient ticket booking facility. The cashback was a surprize.
