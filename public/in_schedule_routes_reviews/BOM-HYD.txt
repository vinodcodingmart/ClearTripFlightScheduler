I often need to travel to Chandigarh, Bangalore and Hyderabad from Mumbai for work. For booking I donâ€™t look elsewhere than Cleartrip as they offer cheap flight fares. Usually I travel by Indigo or Jet Airways, sometimes SpiceJet too. All these rae almost the same but Jet Airways is a little better than other two. Last week, I travelled by Jet Airways and it was a nice experience as always.

Hey guys, never book a flight with JetLite for Mumbai to Hyderabad route because they are not worthwhile. Last month. I travelled with my family by JetLite, their air hostess was very rude to me. I just asked for a seat change and if she could get some hot water and the look she gave me was arrogant.

I searched some cheapest Mumbai to Hyderabad flights on Cleartrip and booked four tickets with SpiceJet airline. Overall my experience was good, but the security check-in at Hyderabad airport was really time consuming.

Last week, I travelled by Indigo-6E496 to reach Hyderabad from Mumbai. It was a cheapest Mumbai to Hyderabad flight which I found on Cleartrip. The taste of the sandwich they served is still in my mouth. It was really delicious though expensive and coffee was also steaming hot. Keep up the good service.

Last month, I travelled from Mumbai to Hyderabad by Jet Airways and it was a nice experience from me. I have booked a flight through Cleartrip mobile app and I got the instant confirmation from Cleartrip. Jet Airways has always been good and this time too they were no different!
