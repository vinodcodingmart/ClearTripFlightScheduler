One of my friends suggested me to look for Mumbai to Ahmadabad flights on Cleartrip at least a month before you travel. So I did the same and scrolled through the site beforehand and found some cheapest flights for this route. I instantly booked Go Air flight tickets. I bought 6 tickets for my family vacation and it was truly a great experience. We had a lot of fun. Service was good, flight can be improved.

Recently, I travelled on a morning flight from Mumbai to Ahmadabad with JetLite. It was fine. Food could be cheaper. I had booked two weeks prior to journey date through Cleartrip. I not only got instant confirmation mail but also saved by getting discount offers. From the airport I took a cab. Overall, my experience with Cleartrip ticket booking system, JetLite and Ahmedabad was wonderful.

Last month, I travelled by Air India-AI31 Mumbai to Ahmadabad flight, and it was a good experience. Their food quality was good, and the plane was also neat and clean. However, they need to add few non-vegetarian dishes on their menu. Cleartrip is the site I trust for online air ticket booking. It offers benefits and discount offers.

Last week, I travelled from Mumbai to Ahmadabad by Indigo and did not like it much. Everything from seats to leg room and food was just average. A definite scope for improvement. However, booking with Cleartrip was fun and I just made my booking with expressway-1 touch flight booking system.

I had to travel with my 6 month old baby and was a bit apprehensive, how things would go. However the air hostess on my Mumbai to Ahmadabad Jet Airways flight was so sweet and took good care of us. She did everything to see my baby smile and made me comfortable. A very kind gesture, which I never expected. Will definitely fly with Jet Airways again.
