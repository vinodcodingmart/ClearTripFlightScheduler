Last week I travelled by Air India â€“ AI570 and I had a great experience with the airline. To top it all I booked the flight through Cleartrip and got a discount on my booking. Food provided on the flight was also good, but their flight condition was not up to the mark.

I have booked Indigo-6E386 to reach Chennai from Mumbai. I am a frequent traveler of this route and I always book Mumbai to Chennai flights through Cleartrip.  This is because Cleartrip offer discounts with cashback deals to their frequent customers.

My wife and I booked Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Chennai. When it was time for boarding their check-in counter was a bit slow as the staff was not really trained. However, booking with Cleartrip was a nice experience because I got the instant booking confirmation with cash-back for my booking.

Easy checking process, hygienic meals and snacks, and on-time arrival are some of the plus points of Go Air. I take a Mumbai to Chennai flight often to go to Tirupati and I always book flights through Cleartrip. It is cost effective, fast, and convenient. GoAir Service is also good. No complaints!

I booked my ticket through online portal called Cleartrip which is very easy to navigate. I simply searched Mumbai to Chennai flights on Cleartrip and found some cheapest flights. I booked on Spice Jet. Since I booked a month earlier I got good price. The flight was also fine. Just that cabin crew could have been more efficient.
