I usually book my flights and hotels through Cleartrip because here I can find the cheapest flights and huge discounts on hotels too. However, I was not happy with Jet Airways service this time when I boarded their Mumbai to Dubai flight. Food was not fresh. Also, their cabin crew was not so professional.

It was really a pleasure to travel with Emirates Airline because the hostesses and flight attendants all were highly professional. There was enough space in the seats, generous food servings, great in-flight entertainment; everything was neat and very comfortable. Also, I save money by booking my tickets through Cleartrip.

Last week, I travelled by Air India Express-IX247 flight to reach Dubai. It was one of the worst Mumbai to Dubai flights because it served stale sandwiches on the flight. Apart from that, their baggage clearance process was also very slow. But I am happy with Cleartrip services because I got the instant flight confirmation through mail and SMS.

I have booked the Fly-Dubai flight to travel from Mumbai to Dubai. After booking my flight, I got the confirmation from Cleartrip. The customer service team is very responsive and supportive. Also, I faced no trouble in flight so I recommend this flight.

My flight booking experience with Cleartrip was a breeze. No doubt Cleartrip has made it so easy. Their flight booking process is very simple, and I could easily find the flights on different routes. Thanks to Cleartrip for providing me the cheapest rate for Mumbai to Dubai flights, and as a regular traveler on this route it is beneficial to me.
