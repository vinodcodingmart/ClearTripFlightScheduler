I booked Mumbai to Lucknow flight last month and was so excited about the journey as I was visiting my grandparents after a long time. But the flight delay by an hour really pissed me off. Thankfully the experience on flight was good. Staff was all there to provide good service. I had booked Air India flight. The flight was delayed and they did not inform me earlier.

I live in Lucknow and I frequently travel on the Mumbai to Lucknow route. I always prefer Cleartrip for booking flight tickets because it is convenient and fast. Last week, I travelled by Indigo-6E495 and it was on time. They provided good service. Thanks to Cleartrip for cash-back!

I have booked Jet Airways-9W374 to reach Lucknow from Mumbai through Cleartrip and it was not a great experience for me. But traveling with Jet Airways was not so great because the toilet was unclean and they did not serve food the way they should. However, booking through Cleartrip mobile app was great fun and also I took me few seconds to book my tickets.

Last week, I was searching some afternoon flights to reach Lucknow from Mumbai and I found few flights on this route on Cleartrip. I have booked JetLite-S24195, which was scheduled to depart at 2.55 P.M from Mumbai. It was on time and I had a great experience travelling with the airline. Also, the flight seats were comfortable and clean.

Recently, I have booked Vistara Airlines-UK994 to reach Lucknow from Mumbai. I always prefer Cleartrip for my flight booking and this time, I got additional discounts on my booking. I was going for a family wedding and kids were excited. Vistara Airline was nice and met our expectations. But they need to improve their baggage clearance services at Mumbai airport because it was very sluggish.
