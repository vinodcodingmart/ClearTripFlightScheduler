I run a business in Bangalore and live in Pune, so have to travel by Pune to Bangalore flight frequently. I always choose Cleartrip to book my flights because it is easy to browse and offers the best deals on flight tickets..  Also, I always prefer traveling with Go Air and Air Asia as they operate their daily flights on this route and they both offer great in-flight services. So I suggest you guys to travel with these airlines if you are planning to travel on this route anytime soon.

I booked a flight (I51425- Air Asia) to reach Bangalore from Pune. It was nice, but their cabin crew was very unprofessional. They had limited food items available and they were not only expensive but tasted bad. However, their merchandise were good and I bought a personalized diary . Thanks to Cleartrip for providing me the best and cost-effective booking facility.

I have heard that Pune to Bangalore Go Air flights are very comfortable so last month I booked 3 tickets through Cleartrip. The plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Food was really good. Largely, I had a great experience.

Last month, I booked an Air Asia flight from Pune to Bangalore through Cleartrip. I had a great experience without any botheration. The seats were comfortable and had enough leg room. Due to this I was able to get enough rest throughout the flight.

A few days ago, I booked Pune to Bangalore flight tickets through Cleartrip, and this was my first time booking ticket online. However, it was a great experience all thanks to Cleartrip. After booking my tickets, I got an email regarding confirmation of my ticket booking. Airfare was cheap so I was happy.
