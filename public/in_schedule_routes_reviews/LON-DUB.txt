Air Canada is a great Airline to fly with from London to Dublin. I flew hassle free with them. They were efficient as always. It was a great experience and we reached on schedule without any delay or hang up at any point.

United is a great Airline to fly with. The flight from London to Dublin was a mere one hour journey and we were quite fresh even after the flight landed. The cabin crew was very endearing and charming, and took great care of each passenger.  For air ticket booking, my choice would be Cleartrip!

We had to reach Dublin in emergency. We took Flybe as it was only available. Our baggage exceeded the limit and we were asked to pay for it. They kept us waiting. It was embarrassing. Thankfully, the flight experience was fine.

I do not know whether the Airlines should be blamed or was it just an unfortunate day but yes, our experience on Lufthansa was horrific . On London to Dublin route, my wife went to the washroom and I was standing right outside as she is claustrophobic. My wife got stuck inside and we could get her out after cabin crew assistance. Luckily there was an on flight doctor who helped us.

Flying with Etihad Airways was great. Legroom sufficient, food offered is of high quality, the staff is cordial and what could we as passengers ask more of a flight. Recommendable to all for they are extremely efficient and systematic.

British Airways gave us an average flight experience on our way from London to Dublin. The interiors were not so good and even the washroom was not properly cleaned. When I complained, they were somewhat rude. I will not recommend them. Though for flight bookings, I would certainly recommend Cleartrip.
