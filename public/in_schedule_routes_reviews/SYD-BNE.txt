Check in with Qantas was seamless and smooth as always, while this was the first time visited the Qantas Club to spend 3 hours before my flight to Brisbane. I even tried Bridge Bar at the airport and relished by appetite with a few snacks and South Wales wine. Boarding again was full of greetings and smiles. Timely departure and arrival, it was overall a nice journey.

I booked my Sydney to Brisbane flight on Virgin Australia using the Cleartrip app and found it quite fast and convenient. Since I am a frequent traveler, I can easily get all flight schedule and other info anytime, anywhere. Also, the food on flight was lip smacking. I wished it was complimentary. Flight was nice and tidy!

Helpful staff in Qantas! My kid was suffering from fever, I asked for a blanket, a cup of Luke warm milk, and the cabin crew took initiative immediately to provide so. I am really grateful.

I enjoyed travelling  with Etihad airways. Starting from my booking through Cleartrip, which was hassle free to the flight from Sydney to Brisbane, it was great. Punctual flight, great welcome, food was excellent and flight was clean. No trouble with seats or legroom. All Good!

Our flight was delayed due to high winds at Sydney airport the entire day. Announcements were made that 2 north-south runways were closed for the day and the flights had to use the east-west runway till afternoon. What I liked about Jetstar was that they kept us constantly updated via SMS PA announcements. Must say good service!

Found Air Newzealand staff at Sydney airport very helpful as my wife had a walking stick and had problem walking. The staff went out of their way to help us through the entire check in and boarding. Service was great, food was good.
