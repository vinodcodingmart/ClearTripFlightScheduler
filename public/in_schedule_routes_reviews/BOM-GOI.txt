I took a Mumbai to Goa flight by GoAir and my experience was just okay.  The staff on the flight behaved rudely not with me but with another traveler who was complaining about toilets not clean. This is not the way to behave with passengers. Flight booking with Cleartrip has no issues and I also got discount of 30% almost. Go Air, please train your staff well!

We had booked four seats on Mumbai to Goa flight by Air India flight but when we reached the airport, we got to know that flight has been delayed by 2 hours due to some technical fault. It was quite frustrating. However, the flight was fine and reached safely.

A month ago I had to reach Mumbai early in the morning so I booked an early morning flight through Cleartrip. I traveled by Jet Airways and found it was quite neat and had a pleasant experience. Also, the beverages on flight were cold and snacks were quite tasteful. I want to thank Cleartrip because they have a hassle free booking facility.

Flying with GoAir was a great experience. The in-flights services, including food, entertainment, etc were also good. I would suggest you guys to travel with this airline and also I am going to book my next flight by the same airline through Cleartrip.

I booked a Mumbai to Goa flight with Cleartrip and guess what! I got a great deal even then. All my friends were so excited. In fact, we would have cancelled our trip if tickets were expensive, so this trip was possible just because of affordable flight tickets at Cleartrip. We took an IndiGo flight and their service was excellent. Thanks IndiGo team!
