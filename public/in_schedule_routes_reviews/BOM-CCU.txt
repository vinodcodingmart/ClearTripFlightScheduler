I live in Kolkata, but I am working in  a Mumbai IT company hence travel on this route often. My first choice for air tickets booking is Cleartrip. Since three years I have been booking Mumbai to Kolkata and Kolkatta to Mumbai flights through them and did not face any serious issues as such. Customer care is quite good. Also their discounts and Cash-Back offers excite me a lot. Last, I travelled was by Indigo-6E496 and it was great. I have used Jet airways also, that is even better.

Last month, I travelled with Jet Airways from Mumbai to Kolkata. The taxi services at Kolkata airport had changed a lot and now they have several counters inside the airport to book local cab at fare price. Regarding air tickets, since I booked my ticket through Cleartrip I got a cashback on booking. So I will definitely recommend Cleartrip if you want cheap air tickets.

Recently I travelled with Air India Mumbai to Kolkata flights and it was a pathetic experience for me. The seat was not so comfortable and there was no air sickness bag. They said, they missed it by mistake. How unprofessional. But my booking with Cleartrip was nice and their customer service team was very supportive.

I searched few Mumbai to Kolkata cheap flights online and I got the best price from Cleartrip. It was an Indigo flight and my experience was also nice for the money I paid. Especially, their checking counter at Mumbai airport was very fast and efficient. Thanks to Cleartrip.

Last week, I travelled with Jet Airways and it was a nice experience for me. Apart from food quality, their merchandise was good. Thanks to Cleartrip for giving me cash-back on my booking and I am for sure going to book my next flight with this airline through Cleartrip because such instant cash-back offers make me so happy.
