Flying to Bangalore from Hyderabad with Air India was no hassle. Easy air tickets booking via Cleartrip! Completely comfortable and smooth functioning of the airline was much appreciated. I reached my destination exactly as scheduled. No complaints from our end. Courteous air hostesses and flight attendants just added to the experience.

We booked our Hyderabad to Bangalore flight ticket through the Cleartrip app without any glitch. On-board, it was good, no problem, as such. One thing, I left my mobile in the plane but luckily got it. Thanks to Indigo Airlines for their professional approach.

We were informed two days prior to our scheduled flight with GOAir that the flight has been cancelled due to unavoidable reasons. They did agree to refund the amount but it took several weeks before the amount got transferred to our account. Moreover, we had to book tickets at a much higher price with another airline.

Great carriers, with comfortable seats, clean washrooms, friendly cabin crew, smooth landing. No issues whatsoever with Jet Airways on the flight from Hyderabad to Bangalore. Would prefer flying with them again.

Booked my Hyderabad to Bangalore flight on CT app. It is quite convenient and fast. I travelled on Spice Jet flight. Apart from food quality, which can certainly be better, I had a nice experience. Recommended by me.

It was a mere 55 minute flight. We did not notice anything out of place during our flight from Hyderabad to Bangalore. Indigo is one of the best Airlines for domestic routes. Facilities and services offered were up to the expected level and the cordiality of the staff was a cherry on the icing. Recommendable flight.
