Checking in Shaheen Airways was so prompt. There was no hassle at all. The cabin staff was friendly who suggested me very good quality food. Asian styled lunch and a European dinner just made my flight experience happy.

Today I just travelled from Lahore to Karachi and I had a pleasant experience. It was a pleasing experience to see smiling face in the cabin crew. Crew members were really helpful. I asked them for coffee. She remembered my seat and gave my coffee I did not have to ask second time. Sohail Ahmed

It is indeed a low cost airline. Shaheen Air Airlines is indeed good. The airport checks in was not good. The agents took a lot of time. The flight also had a gate change 4 days. There was also 1 hour delay for the flight. However flight attendants were very friendly. Aircraft was good and meals served were good too.

Flight has reached Lahore 1.5 hours. Rest all was okay. The flight attendants were nice. First 3 rows were empty. My seat was in the 4th row. As I requested they moved me up. I had a comfortable journey. Graham B.
