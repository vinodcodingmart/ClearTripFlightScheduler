I enjoyed a punctual and comfortable flight from Doha to Kolkata on Qatar Airways. A dedicated jet bridge made us enter the cabin of the business class. Menu card and meal choices really excited me. I especially loved the spacious cabin and the seats that could lie flat. Had a nice experience as usual!

I had a decent experience on board A351. Everything went smooth, no rush anywhere. Professional and pleasant team assisted passengers. The only setback was that while we were on the airbus towards the aircraft, the announcements sounded vague. Had to be always alert.

The flight took me total of 14 hours. But the leg space given was awesome. We had been given blankets, Eye masks, socks, and earplugs. What a crew indeed.

As always good service and a great flight. Our connecting flight was delayed so they even arranged for the accommodation.
