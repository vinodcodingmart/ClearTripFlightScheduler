It was my first travel with the Nesma, and I was quite impressed by their service. The crew was very kind and supportive and took care of every passenger with special attention. Though it was my first domestic travel with the airline, I will fly with them again both domestic and international.

I traveled with Nesma Airline to Riyadh and the flight was delayed for an hour. It was extremely frustrating, but I must say that the airline staff handled the situation well and kept everyone informed. The staff was extremely supportive and apologized to the travelers and informed us that the delay was caused due to technical issues. Throughout the journey, the cabin crew was active to respond to the passenger requirement and needs. They had good meal option.

If you have to get anywhere in a hurry, do not take Nesma. Though it was my first domestic travel with the airline, I will fly with them again both domestic and international.

I have been a regular traveler to Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam due to my business requirement. I have travelled with Nesma many times and did not face any major issue. Excellent airline, on-time service, very attentive crew, excellent customer service, and the airline staff were always ready to assist and help the passengers. One of the best in Saudi Arabia.
